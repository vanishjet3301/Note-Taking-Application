# Note Taking Application
Simple note taking app that provides creating, renaming, deletion text files and saving text in them. 
#### Known Issues
1) There are no implementation of saving and binding time of creation\change to note itself.
2) Scrollbar is not synchronized between listboxes when notes do not fit on form.
3) Default naming may work strange sometimes, for instance note with name "Note Name3" may be created first instead of note with name "Note Name2".
## Also, do not delete text files or change information about them without using given interface unless you want to break the app
